== Arduino and Rust examples
This repository contains implementation of classical Arduino examples in Rust language using https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal[avr-hal]

This repository based on tutorials from http://wiki.amperka.ru/%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82-arduino#%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8B[Amperka wiki]. Amperka is Russian's store which sells Arduino kits and extensions. But there is not full implementation of all examples and I changed some of them. I suppose that some examples is too simple or don't give new experience compare to previous.

## SimulIDE Projects

Some projects contains https://www.simulide.com/p/home.html[SimulIDE] project (*.sim1). It allow to run example without making a physical schemes. 

How to run a project in SimulIDE:

. Use script ``build-to-hex.sh <example_folder>``, for ex: ``build-to-hex.sh 01_blink``. Script writes the path to result HEX file.
. Open project in SimulIDE
. Right click on Arduino 
. Click "Load firmware" and select <buildname.hex>

**Warning!** Some projects has simulated in slower mode. For example `02_blink_fade` executed on 50% of real speed. I did it for more clarity.

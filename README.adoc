== Arduino and Rust examples
This repository contains implementation of classical Arduino examples in Rust language using https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal[avr-hal]

Original source  of examples is http://wiki.amperka.ru/%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82-arduino#%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8B[Amperka wiki]. Amperka is Russian's store of starting Arduino kits and extensions.

| Example  | Description | AVR (or Rust) techniques | Arduino functions 

| 01_blink 
| Blinking led - Hello world in the Arduino.  
| * Toggle led 
  * delay milliseconds 
|  * delay
   * digitalWrite


| 02_blink_fade 
| Led with different brightness 
| Fast PWM mode 
| * analogWrite

| 03_pot_light 
| LED with controlled by pot brightness
| ADC, using pot
| * analogRead

| 05_night_light
| LED on/off controlled by pot and photoconductive cell
| ADC, using pot and photoconductive
| * analogRead

| 06_pulsar_bar
| Smoothly change brighntess of LED ABr
| Timer interrupts, using atomic variables
| * analogWrite
  * millis


| 07_running_bar
| Sequentially on/off leds in a bar
| AVR-Rust specific - use pins in array.
| * digitalWrite

| 09_mixer
| Changes speed of motor by buttons
| pull-up pins
| * pinMode PULLUP
  * digitalRead
  * digitalWrite

| 10_led_toggle
| On/off led by button
| Nothing new compare to 09_mixer
| 

| 11_inc_dec_light
| Change brightness of led with 2 buttons
| External Interrupts (INT0, INT1) 
  
Issue with Fast PWM
| * attachInterrupt

| 13_seven_segment_counter
| Change digit from 0 to 9 per seconds on 7 segments counter.
| struct as indicator's model
